# yolo-v2-v3 and tiny model
Hi, guys ! 

Since I have replace SubtractMean func with Normalize func in ```utils/augmentation.py```, all previous trained models 
don't work. Don't worry ! I have trained the new models !

In addition, I addressed a bug in my ```train_coco.py```, so I will also upload the COCO trained models!


For researchers in China, you can download them from BaiduYunDisk. 
There are 5 models including yolo-v2, yolo-v3 (darknet53), yolo-v3 (darknet19), tiny-yolo-v2 and tiny-yolo-v3.
